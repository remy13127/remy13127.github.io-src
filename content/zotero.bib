	abstract = {Theoretical and experimental work concerned with dynamic fluctuations has developed into a very active and fascinating subfield of mesoscopic physics. We present a review of this development focusing on shot noise in small electric conductors. Shot noise is a consequence of the quantization of charge. It can be used to obtain information on a system which is not available through conductance measurements. In particular, shot noise experiments can determine the charge and statistics of the quasiparticles relevant for transport, and reveal information on the potential profile and internal energy scales of mesoscopic systems. Shot noise is generally more sensitive to the effects of electron-electron interactions than the average conductance. We present a discussion based on the conceptually transparent scattering approach and on the classical Langevin and Boltzmann-Langevin methods; in addition a discussion of results which cannot be obtained by these methods is provided. We conclude the review by pointing out a number of unsolved problems and an outlook on the likely future development of the field.},

For ergodic long-time dynamics, we derive the           relationship between the droplet’s stationary statistical distribution and its mean wave           field in a very general setting. We then focus on the case of a droplet subjected to a           harmonic potential with its motion confined to a line. By analyzing the system’s periodic           states, we reveal a number of dynamical regimes, including those characterized by           stationary bouncing droplets trapped by the harmonic potential, periodic quantized           oscillations, chaotic motion and wavelike statistics, and periodic wave-trapped droplet           motion that may persist even in the absence of a central force. We demonstrate that as the           vibrational forcing is increased progressively, the periodic oscillations become chaotic           via the Ruelle-Takens-Newhouse route. We rationalize the role of the local pilot-wave           structure on the resulting droplet motion, which is akin to a random walk. We characterize           the emergence of wavelike statistics influenced by the effective potential that is induced           by the mean Faraday wave field.},

It is possible to inject more fluid into the drop to increase its diameter up to several centimeters. Such a drop remains at the surface, forming a large sunk hemisphere. When the oscillation is stopped, the two fluids remain separated by a very thin air film, which drains very slowly (approximately 30 min).

Elle déplaça deux miroirs, situés à des kilomètres de distance, d'une fraction de la taille d'un proton. Messagère du ciel, elle apportait la nouvelle de la fusion de deux trous noirs il y a 1,5 milliard d'années, balayant d'un seul coup les doutes d'Einstein et de ses successeurs : non seulement les trous noirs existent, mais ils peuvent être en couple, et émettre alors des ondes gravitationnelles. Ce livre retrace toute l'aventure de cette découverte.

Localization of continuous sounds also was tested to estimate errors in the motor act of orienting with the head. Localization performance was excellent for brief sounds presented in front of the subject. The smallest errors, averaged across subjects, were about 2 degrees and 3.5 degrees in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, respectively. The sizes of errors increased, for more peripheral stimulus locations, to maxima of about 20 degrees. Localization performance was better in the horizontal than in the vertical dimension for stimuli located on or near the frontal midline, but the opposite was true for most stimuli located further peripheral. Front/back confusions occurred in 6\% of trials; the characteristics of those responses suggest that subjects derived horizontal localization information principally from interaural difference cues.

In this paper, a simple, closed-form solution is obtained for scattering by a sphere with a radius that is small compared to the wavelength. Soft, hard, impedance, and fluid obstacles are considered. The solution is valid for arbitrary positions of the source and receiver relative to the scatterer. Low-frequency scattering is shown to be rather sensitive to boundary conditions on the surface of the obstacle. Low-frequency asymptotics of the scattered acoustic field are extended to transient incident waves. The asymptotic expansions admit an intuitive interpretation in terms of image sources and reduce to classical results in appropriate limiting cases.},

The predictions by the Woodworth model for antipodal ears and for incident plane waves are here compared with the predictions of the exact model as a function of frequency to quantify the discrepancy when the frequency is not high. In a second calculation, the Woodworth model is extended to arbitrary ear angles, both for plane-wave incidence and for finite point-source distance. The extended Woodworth model leads to different formulas in six different regions defined by ear angle and source distance. It is noted that the characteristic cusp in Woodworth's well-known function comes from ignoring the longer of the two paths around the head in circumstances when the longer path is actually important.

	abstract = {The field of spatial hearing has exploded in the decade or so since Jens Blauert's classic work on acoustics was first published in English. This revised edition adds a new chapter that describes developments in such areas as auditory virtual reality (an important field of application that is based mainly on the physics of spatial hearing), binaural technology (modeling speech enhancement by binaural hearing), and spatial sound-field mapping. The chapter also includes recent research on the precedence effect that provides clear experimental evidence that cognition plays a significant role in spatial hearing.The remaining four chapters in this comprehensive reference cover auditory research procedures and psychometric methods, spatial hearing with one sound source, spatial hearing with multiple sound sources and in enclosed spaces, and progress and trends from 1972 (the first German edition) to 1983 (the first English edition) -- work that includes research on the physics of the external ear, and the application of signal processing theory to modeling the spatial hearing process. There is an extensive bibliography of more than 900 items.},

	volume = {107},

	shorttitle = {Tori of confusion},
	abstract = {To a first-order approximation, binaural localization cues are ambiguous: many source locations give rise to nearly the same interaural differences. For sources more than a meter away, binaural localization cues are approximately equal for any source on a cone centered on the interaural axis (i.e., the well-known "cone of confusion"). The current paper analyzes simple geometric approximations of a head to gain insight into localization performance for nearby sources. If the head is treated as a rigid, perfect sphere, interaural intensity differences (IIDs) can be broken down into two main components. One component depends on the head shadow and is constant along the cone of confusion (and covaries with the interaural time difference, or ITD). The other component depends only on the relative path lengths from the source to the two ears and is roughly constant for a sphere centered on the interaural axis. This second factor is large enough to be perceptible only when sources are within one or two meters of the listener. Results are not dramatically different if one assumes that the ears are separated by 160 deg along the surface of the sphere (rather than diametrically opposite one another). Thus for nearby sources, binaural information should allow listeners to locate sources within a volume around a circle centered on the interaural axis on a "torus of confusion." The volume of the torus of confusion increases as the source approaches the median plane, degenerating to a volume around the median plane in the limit.},

However, auditory space is not represented in any systematic manner on the basilar membrane of the cochlea, the sensory surface of the receptor organ for hearing. Understanding the means by which sensitivity to spatial cues is computed in central neurons can therefore contribute to our understanding of the basic nature of complex neural representations. We review recent evidence concerning the nature of the neural representation of auditory space in the mammalian brain and elaborate on recent advances in the understanding of mammalian subcortical processing of auditory spatial cues that challenge the “textbook” version of sound localization, in particular brain mechanisms contributing to binaural hearing.},

transient nature of the population dynamics, and the crucial role of the distribution of the times of flight of atoms through the probe beam. Experimental results are obtained with room temperature rubidium vapor probed by an extended-cavity diode laser and confirm our theoretical prediction.},

We discuss a simple experiment using wavelength modulation spectroscopy and near infrared diode lasers operating in the 780 nm region to detect rubidium hyperfine spectra. Modulation spectroscopy techniques are employed to improve the signal to noise ratio for the detection of weak signals and thus significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity for detection. By using quantum cascade lasers and wavelength modulation spectroscopy, one can detect trace species at sub-ppm level, which has numerous applications in diverse areas such as medical diagnostics, food processing, industrial applications, and environmental monitoring.},

Such a statement requires, however, knowledge on details of the light generation process, which were not known until the advent of true single-photon light sources such as isolated single atoms or molecules. Here, starting from a two atom light source, it is shown that probably multi-atom or multi-molecule light sources do not generate, even not in small fractions, antibunching photons and that attenuation down to one photon per time unit is not reliably possible. Thus, one of the strongest arguments in favour of the existence of single "photons" in free space, the accumulation time argument, which discusses the absorption of a single photon by a single atom or molecule, becomes questionable.},

We created a task in which rats learned a difficult motor sequence characterized by fine-tuned changes in running speed adjusted to spatial and temporal constraints. After training and extensive practice, we found that the behavior was habitual, yet tetrode recordings in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) revealed continuous integrative representations of running speed, position and time. These representations were weak in naive rats that were hand-guided to perform the same sequence and developed slowly after learning. Finally, DLS inactivation in well-trained animals preserved the structure of the sequence while increasing its trial-by-trial variability. We conclude that, after learning, the DLS continuously integrates task-relevant information to constrain the execution of motor habits. Our results provide a straightforward mechanism by which the basal ganglia may contribute to habit formation and motor control.},

A popular hypothesis is that the dorsal striatum generates discrete “traffic light” signals that initiate, maintain, and terminate the execution of learned actions. Alternatively, the striatum may continuously monitor the dynamics of movements associated with action execution by processing inputs from somatosensory and motor cortices. Here, we recorded the activity of striatal neurons in mice performing a run-and-stop task and characterized the diversity of firing rate modulations relative to run performance (tuning curves) across neurons. We found that the tuning curves could not be statistically clustered in discrete functional groups (start or stop neurons). Rather, their shape varied continuously according to the movement dynamics of the task. Moreover, striatal spiking activity correlated with running speed on a run-by-run basis and was modulated by task-related non-locomotor movements, such as licking. We hypothesize that such moment-to-moment movement monitoring by the dorsal striatum contributes to the learning of adaptive actions and/or updating their kinematics.},

An extension to Keller's work is considered, modeling the aforementioned energy loss as a simple function of the centrifugal force acting on the runner around the curve. Theoretical World Record performances for indoor and outdoor 200m are discussed, and the use of the model at 300m is investigated. Some predictions are made for possible 200m outdoor and indoor times as run by Canadian 100m WR holder Donovan Bailey, based on his 100m final performance at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate how CasADi, a recently developed, free, open-source, general purpose software tool for nonlinear optimization, can be used for dynamic optimization in a flexible, interactive and numerically efficient way. CasADi is best described as a minimalistic computer algebra system (CAS) implementing automatic differentiation (AD) in eight different flavors. Similar to algebraic modeling languages like AMPL or GAMS, it includes high-level interfaces to state-of-the-art numerical codes for nonlinear programming, quadratic programming and integration of differentialalgebraic equations. CasADi is implemented in self-contained C++ code and contains full-featured front-ends to Python and Octave for rapid prototyping. In this paper, we discuss CasADi from the perspective of the developer or advanced user of algorithms for dynamic optimization for the first time, leaving out details on the implementation of the tool. We demonstrate how the tool can be used to model highly complex dynamical systems directly or import existing models formulated in the algebraic modeling language AMPL or the physical modeling language Modelica. Given this symbolic representation of the process models, the resulting optimal control problem can be solved using a variety of methods, including transcription methods (collocation), methods with embedded integrators (multiple shooting) as well as indirect methods.},

	abstract = {A collocation solution u h to a functional equation (for example an ordinary differential equation or a Volterra integral equation) on an interval I is an element from some finite-dimensional function space (the collocation space) which satisfies the equation on an appropriate finite subset of points in I (the set of collocation points) whose cardinality essentially matches the dimension of the collocation space. If initial (or boundary) conditions are present then u h will usually be required to fulfil these conditions, too. The use of polynomial or piecewise polynomial collocation spaces for the approximate solution of boundary-value problems has its origin in the 1930s. For initial-value problems in ordinary differential equations such collocation methods were first studied systematically in the late 1960s: it was then shown that collocation in continuous piecewise polynomial spaces leads to an important class of implicit (high-order) Runge–Kutta methods. Consider the initial-value problem y (t) = f (t, y(t)), t ∈ I := [0, T ], y(0) = y 0 , (1.1.1) and assume that the (Lipschitz-) continuous function f : I × ⊂ IR → IR is such that (1.1.1) possesses a unique solution y ∈ C 1 (I) for all y 0 ∈. Let I h := \{t n : 0 = t 0 {\textless} t 1 {\textless}. .. {\textless} t N = T \} be a given (not necessarily uniform) mesh on I , and set σ n := (t n , t n+1 ], ¯},

	abstract = {The project of this thesis is twofold. The first concerns the extension of previous results on necessary optimality conditions for state constrained problems in optimal control and in calculus of variations. The second aim consists in working along two new research lines: derive viability results for a class of control systems with state constraints in which ‘standard inward pointing conditions’ are violated; and establish necessary optimality conditions for average cost minimization problems possibly perturbed by unknown parameters.In the first part, we examine necessary optimality conditions which play an important role in finding candidates to be optimal solutions among all admissible solutions. However, in dynamic optimization problems with state constraints, some pathological situations might arise. For instance, it might occur that the multiplier associated with the objective function (to minimize) vanishes. In this case, the objective function to minimize does not intervene in first order necessary conditions: this is referred to as the abnormal case. A worse phenomenon, called the degenerate case shows that in some circumstances the set of admissible trajectories coincides with the set of candidates to be minimizers. Therefore the necessary conditions give no information on the possible minimizers.To overcome these difficulties, new additional hypotheses have to be imposed, known as constraint qualifications. We investigate these two issues (normality and non-degeneracy) for optimal control problems involving state constraints and dynamics expressed as a differential inclusion, when the minimizer has its left end-point in a region where the state constraint set in nonsmooth. We prove that under an additional information involving mainly the Clarke tangent cone, necessary conditions in the form of the Extended Euler-Lagrange condition are derived in the normal and non-degenerate form for two different classes of state constrained optimal control problems. Application of the normality result is shown also for the calculus of variations problem subject to a state constraint.In the second part of the thesis, we consider first a class of state constrained control systems for which standard ‘first order’ constraint qualifications are not satisfied, but a higher (second) order constraint qualification is satisfied. We propose a new construction for feasible trajectories (a viability result) and we investigate examples (such as the Brockett nonholonomic integrator) providing in addition a non-linear stimate result. The other topic of the second part of the thesis concerns the study of a class of optimal control problems in which uncertainties appear in the data in terms of unknown parameters. Taking into consideration an average cost criterion, a crucial issue is clearly to be able to characterize optimal controls independently of the unknown parameter action: this allows to find a sort of ‘best compromise’ among all the possible realizations of the control system as the parameter varies. For this type of problems, we derive necessary optimality conditions in the form of Maximum Principle (possibly nonsmooth).},

We used a delay discounting measure to test the degree to which patients make future-oriented decisions.
METHODS: 42 patients with schizophrenia and 29 healthy participants completed a delay discounting measure along with tests of cognitive function and, in patients, symptom ratings.
RESULTS: Patients discounted more steeply than did comparison participants. Discounting among patients related to memory capacity and tended to relate inversely to negative symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: The impulsive decision making evidenced by patients suggests that they may be prone to choosing immediate over long-term rewards, even when their interests are better served by choosing the latter. Improving cognitive function may enhance their ability to make future-oriented decisions.},

	abstract = {When coordinating movements, the nervous system often has to decide how to distribute work across a number of redundant effectors. Here, we show that humans solve this problem by trying to minimize both the variability of motor output and the effort involved. In previous studies that investigated the temporal shape of movements, these two selective pressures, despite having very different theoretical implications, could not be distinguished; because noise in the motor system increases with the motor commands, minimization of effort or variability leads to very similar predictions. When multiple effectors with different noise and effort characteristics have to be combined, however, these two cost terms can be dissociated. Here, we measure the importance of variability and effort in coordination by studying how humans share force production between two fingers. To capture variability, we identified the coefficient of variation of the index and little fingers. For effort, we used the sum of squared forces and the sum of squared forces normalized by the maximum strength of each effector. These terms were then used to predict the optimal force distribution for a task in which participants had to produce a target total force of 4–16 N, by pressing onto two isometric transducers using different combinations of fingers. By comparing the predicted distribution across fingers to the actual distribution chosen by participants, we were able to estimate the relative importance of variability and effort of 1∶7, with the unnormalized effort being most important. Our results indicate that the nervous system uses multi-effector redundancy to minimize both the variability of the produced output and effort, although effort costs clearly outweighed variability costs.},

	abstract = {To execute a movement, the CNS must appropriately select and activate the set of muscles that will produce the desired movement. This problem is particularly difficult because a variety of muscle subsets can usually be used to produce the same joint motion. The motor system is therefore faced with a motor redundancy problem that must be resolved to produce the movement. In this paper, we present a model of muscle recruitment in the wrist step-tracking task. Muscle activation levels for five muscles are selected so as to satisfy task constraints (moving to the designated target) while also minimizing a measure of the total effort in producing the movement. Imposing these constraints yields muscle activation patterns qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally. In particular, the model reproduces the observed cosine-like recruitment of muscles as a function of movement direction and also appropriately predicts that certain muscles will be recruited most strongly in movement directions that differ significantly from their direction of action. These results suggest that the observed recruitment behavior may not be an explicit strategy employed by the nervous system, but instead may result from a process of movement optimization.},

                In Biological Learning and Control, Reza Shadmehr and Sandro Mussa-Ivaldi present a theoretical framework for understanding the regularity of the brain's perceptions, its reactions to sensory stimuli, and its control of movements. They offer an account of perception as the combination of prediction and observation: the brain builds internal models that describe what should happen and then combines this prediction with reports from the sensory system to form a belief.Considering the brain's control of movements, and variations despite biomechanical similarities among old and young, healthy and unhealthy, and humans and other animals, Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi review evidence suggesting that motor commands reflect an economic decision made by our brain weighing reward and effort. This evidence also suggests that the brain prefers to receive a reward sooner than later, devaluing or discounting reward with the passage of time; then as the value of the expected reward changes in the brain with the passing of time (because of development, disease, or evolution), the shape of our movements will also change.The internal models formed by the brain provide the brain with an essential survival skill: the ability to predict based on past observations. The formal concepts presented by Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi offer a way to describe how representations are formed, what structure they have, and how the theoretical concepts can be tested.},

Yet, the principles underlying the formation of human movement vigour remain unclear, particularly in view of intriguing inter-individual variability. It has been hypothesized that how the brain values time may be the cornerstone of such differences, beyond biomechanics. Here, we focused on the vigour of self-paced reaching movement and assessed the stability of vigour via repeated measurements within participants. We used an optimal control methodology to identify a cost of time (CoT) function underlying each participant’s vigour, considering a model of the biomechanical cost of movement. We then tested the extent to which anthropometric or psychological traits, namely boredom proneness and impulsivity, could account for a significant part of inter-individual variance in vigour and CoT parameters. Our findings show that the vigour of reaching is largely idiosyncratic and tend to corroborate a relation between the relative steepness of the identified CoT and boredom proneness, a psychological trait relevant to one’s relationship with time in decision-making.},

Studies on myriad species have added to our knowledge about the general cost of animal movement, including the effects of variations in the environment such as terrain angle. However, further such studies might provide diminishing returns on the development of a deeper understanding of how animals trade-off the cost of movement with other energy costs, and other ecological currencies such as time. Here, I propose the ‘individual energy landscape’ as an approach to conceptualising the choices facing the optimising animal. In this Commentary, first I outline previous broad findings about animal walking and running locomotion, focusing in particular on the use of net cost of transport as a metric of comparison between species, and then considering the effects of environmental perturbations and other extrinsic factors on movement costs. I then introduce and explore the idea that these factors combine with the behaviour of the animal in seeking short-term optimality to create that animal’s individual energy landscape – the result of the geographical landscape and environmental factors combined with the animal’s selected tradeoffs. Considering an animal’s locomotion energy expenditure within this context enables hard-won empirical data on transport costs to be applied to questions about how an animal can and does move through its environment to maximise its fitness, and the relative importance, or otherwise, of locomotion energy economy.},

	abstract = {Passive dynamic walking is a useful model for investigating the mechanical functions of the body that produce energy-efficient walking. The basin of attraction is very small and thin, and it has a fractal-like shape; this explains the difficulty in producing stable passive dynamic walking. The underlying mechanism that produces these geometric characteristics was not known. In this paper, we consider this from the viewpoint of dynamical systems theory, and we use the simplest walking model to clarify the mechanism that forms the basin of attraction for passive dynamic walking. We show that the intrinsic saddle-type hyperbolicity of the upright equilibrium point in the governing dynamics plays an important role in the geometrical characteristics of the basin of attraction; this contributes to our understanding of the stability mechanism of bipedal walking.},

	abstract = {Summary We compared backward with forward running to test the idea that the application of ground force to support the weight of the body determines the energetic cost of running. We hypothesized that higher metabolic rates during backward versus forward running would be directly related to greater rates of ground force application and the volume of muscle activated to apply support forces to the ground. Four trained males ran backward and forward under steady-state conditions at eight treadmill speeds from 1.75 to 3.50 m s−1. Rates of oxygen uptake were measured to determine metabolic rates, and inverse periods of foot–ground contact (1/tc) were measured to estimate rates of ground force application. As expected, at all eight speeds, both metabolic rates and estimated rates of ground force application were greater for backward than for forward running. At the ﬁve slowest speeds, the differences in rates of ground force application were directly proportional to the differences in metabolic rates between modes (paired t-test, P{\textless}0.05), but at the three highest speeds, small but signiﬁcant differences in proportionality were present in this relationship. At one of these three higher speeds (3.0 m s−1), additional measurements to estimate muscle volumes were made using a non-invasive force plate/video technique. These measurements indicated that the volume of muscle active per unit of force applied to the ground was 10±3 \% greater when running backward than forward at this speed. The product of rates of ground force application and estimated muscle volumes predicted a difference in metabolic rate that was indistinguishable from the difference we measured (34±6 \% versus 35±6 \%; means ± S.E.M., N=4). We conclude that metabolic rates during running are determined by rates of ground force application and the volume of muscle activated to apply support forces to the ground.},

	abstract = {People generally select a similar speed for a given motor task, such as reaching for a cup. One well established determinant of movement time is the speed–accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed–accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, Nc). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and Nc. Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed–accuracy trade-off). However, Nc was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of Nc on movement energy cost (slope SN) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in SN suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. SN was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit “motor motivation.”},

Suppose that the purpose of any movement is to position our body in a more rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a hyperbolic function of time. Here, we show that across populations of people and monkeys there is a correlation between discounting of reward and control of movements. We consider saccadic eye movements and hypothesize that duration of a movement is equivalent to a delay of reward. The hyperbolic cost of this delay not only accounts for kinematics of saccades in adults, it also accounts for the faster saccades of children, who temporally discount reward more steeply. Our theory explains why saccade velocities increase when reward is elevated, and why disorders in the encoding of reward, for example in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, produce changes in saccade. We show that delay of reward elevates the cost of saccades, reducing velocities. Finally, we consider coordinated movements that include motion of eyes and head and find that their kinematics is also consistent with a hyperbolic, reward-dependent cost of time. Therefore, each voluntary movement carries a cost because its duration delays acquisition of reward. The cost depends on the value that the brain assigns to stimuli, and the rate at which it discounts this value in time. The motor commands that move our eyes reflect this cost of time.},

	abstract = {To want something now rather than later is a common attitude that reflects the brain's tendency to value the passage of time. Because the time taken to accomplish an action inevitably delays task achievement and reward acquisition, this idea was ported to neural movement control within the “cost of time” theory. This theory provides a normative framework to account for the underpinnings of movement time formation within the brain and the origin of a self-selected pace in human and animal motion. Then, how does the brain exactly value time in the control of action? To tackle this issue, we used an inverse optimal control approach and developed a general methodology allowing to squarely sample infinitesimal values of the time cost from experimental motion data. The cost of time underlying saccades was found to have a concave growth, thereby confirming previous results on hyperbolic reward discounting, yet without making any prior assumption about this hypothetical nature. For self-paced reaching, however, movement time was primarily valued according to a striking sigmoidal shape; its rate of change consistently presented a steep rise before a maximum was reached and a slower decay was observed. Theoretical properties of uniqueness and robustness of the inferred time cost were established for the class of problems under investigation, thus reinforcing the significance of the present findings. These results may offer a unique opportunity to uncover how the brain values the passage of time in healthy and pathological motor control and shed new light on the processes underlying action invigoration.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Movement time is a fundamental characteristic of neural motor control, but the principles underlying its formation remain little known. This work addresses that question within the inverse optimal control framework where the challenge is to uncover what optimality criterion underlies a system's behavior. Here we rely on the “cost of time” theory that finds its roots into the brain's tendency to discount the actual value of future reward. It asserts that the time elapsed until action completion entails a cost, thereby making slow moves nonoptimal. By means of a thorough theoretical analysis, the present article shows how to sample the infinitesimal values of the time cost without prior assumption about its hypothetical nature and emphasizes its sigmoidal shape for reaching.},

	abstract = {Does limb design influence the cost of locomotion in quadrupedal mammals? If not, morphologists must dismiss the economy of locomotion from consideration when assessing the adaptive factors shaping limb structure. Several studies have recently used externally applied loads to demonstrate a relationship between limb mass distribution and energy costs in human subjects. It is not clear whether a similar correlation would hold for quadrupeds, given their very different gaits. The present study addresses this question by measuring the rate of oxygen consumption in domestic dogs running on a treadmill with mass added either to the limbs or to the back. Trials with no additional mass were used as a control. The use of externally applied loads has the advantage of allowing limb mass to be altered in a system in which other aspects of physiology that might influence cost of locomotion are held constant. The cost of adding mass to the limbs in dogs was found to be significantly greater than that of adding it at the center of mass. Limb mass distribution does affect the cost of locomotion in quadrupeds. A comparison of the results from a variety of studies in which the energetic cost of adding external loads has been measured in animals across a wide size range suggests a qualitative difference in the factors determining the cost of locomotion in large and small animals.},

In walking the efficiency reaches a maximum (0·35-0·40) at intermediate speeds, as may be expected from the properties of the contractile component of muscle. In running the efficiency increases steadily with speed (from 0·45 to 0·70-0·80) suggesting that positive work derives mainly from the passive recoil of muscle elastic elements and to a lesser extent from the active shortening of the contractile machinery.

The relationship in its hyperbolic form indicates that for any given step length within the normal range of walking speeds (approximately up to 145 m/min) there is a unique step rate which requires minimal energy expenditure per unit distance traversed. Matching the given step length with any other step rate results in greater energy demand. As derived here, the condition of optimality requires that the step rate be directly proportional to the step length with a subject-dependent proportionality constant. Imposing this optimality constraint on the hyperbolic form yields an optimal pattern equation which virtually coincides, up to speeds of about 100 m/min, with an empirical equation of quadratic form, found by a number of investigators to adequately relate energy expenditure to speed under moderate walking conditions.},

Evidence on seven subjects indicates that the energy demand for such a combination can be determined by conducting two experiments. In the first, the subject is allowed to freely choose his own walking pattern to achieve a set of prescribed speeds. In the second, the speed is kept constant but the subject is forced to adopt a range of prescribed step rates. The results of the two experiments combined yield enough data to make possible the determination of the energy equation of the pattern, encompassing both "free" and "forced" gaits. Results show that the freely chosen step rate requires the least oxygen consumption at any given speed. Any other forced step rate at the same speed increases the oxygen cost over that required for the "free" step rate.},

	abstract = {We use the Iocco et al. (2015) compilation of 2,780 circular velocity measurements to analyze the Milky Way rotation curve. We ﬁnd that the error bars for individual measurements are non-gaussian, and hence instead derive median statistics binned central circular velocity values and error bars from these data. We use these median statistics central values and error bars to ﬁt the data to simple, few parameter, rotation curve functions. These simple functions are unable to adequately capture the signiﬁcant small scale spatial structure in these data and so provide poor ﬁts. We introduce and use the Gaussian Processes (GP) method to capture this small scale structure and use it to derive Milky Way rotation curves from the binned median statistics circular velocity data. The GP method rotation curves have signiﬁcant small-scale spatial structure superimposed on a broad rise to galactocentric radius R ≈ 7 kpc and a decline at larger R. We use the GP method median statistics rotation curve to measure the Oort A and B constants and other characteristic rotation curve quantities. We study correlations in the residual circular velocities (relative to the GP method rotation curve). Along with other evidence for azimuthal asymmetry of the Milky Way circular rotation velocity ﬁeld, we ﬁnd that larger residual circular velocities seem to favor parts of spiral arms.},

Using Bayesian regression, we deﬁne an estimator for the underlying truth distribution as the mode of the posterior. We show that in the case where the bin contents are distributed approximately according to a Gaussian, this estimator is equivalent to the mean function of a GP conditioned on the maximum likelihood estimator. Regularisation is introduced via the kernel function of the GP, which has a natural interpretation as the covariance of the underlying distribution. This novel approach allows for the regularisation to be informed by prior knowledge of the underlying distribution, and for it to be varied along the spectrum. In addition, the full statistical covariance matrix for the estimator is obtained as part of the result. The method is applied to two examples: a double-peaked bimodal distribution and a falling spectrum.},

Graphene can sustain current densities 6 orders higher than copper, shows record thermal conductivity and stiffness, is impermeable to gases and reconciles such conflicting qualities as brittleness and ductility. Electron transport in graphene is described by a Dirac-like equation, which allows the investigation of relativistic quantum phenomena in a bench-top experiment.

	abstract = {Excessive weight in adults is a national concern with over 2/3 of the US population deemed overweight. Because being overweight has been correlated to numerous diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, there is a need to understand mechanisms and predict outcomes of weight change and weight maintenance. A simple mathematical model that accurately predicts individual weight change offers opportunities to understand how individuals lose and gain weight and can be used to foster patient adherence to diets in clinical settings. For this purpose, we developed a one dimensional differential equation model of weight change based on the energy balance equation is paired to an algebraic relationship between fat free mass and fat mass derived from a large nationally representative sample of recently released data collected by the Centers for Disease Control. We validate the model's ability to predict individual participants’ weight change by comparing model estimates of final weight data from two recent underfeeding studies and one overfeeding study. Mean absolute error and standard deviation between model predictions and observed measurements of final weights are less than 1.8 ± 1.3 kg for the underfeeding studies and 2.5 ± 1.6 kg for the overfeeding study. Comparison of the model predictions to other one dimensional models of weight change shows improvement in mean absolute error, standard deviation of mean absolute error, and group mean predictions. The maximum absolute individual error decreased by approximately 60\% substantiating reliability in individual weight change predictions. The model provides a viable method for estimating individual weight change as a result of changes in intake and determining individual dietary adherence during weight change studies.},

	abstract = {As obesity and its related health problems grow around the world, efforts to control and manage weight is increasing in importance. It is well known that altering and maintaining weight is problematic and this has led to specific studies trying to determine the cause of the difficulty. Recent research has identified that the body reacts to forced weight change by adapting individual total energy expenditure. Key factors are an adaptation of resting metabolic rate, non-exercise activity thermogenesis and dietary induced thermogenesis. We develop a differential equation model based on the first law of thermodynamics that incorporates all three adjustments along with natural age related reduction of the resting metabolic rate. Forward time simulations of the model compare well with mean data in both overfeeding and caloric restriction studies.},

	abstract = {A small liquid drop can be kept bouncing on the surface of a bath of the same fluid for an unlimited time when this substrate oscillates vertically. With fluids of low viscosity the repeated collisions generate a surface wave at the bouncing frequency. The various dynamical regimes of the association of the drop with its wave are investigated first. The drop, usually a simple ‘bouncer’, undergoes a drift bifurcation when the forcing amplitude is increased. It thus becomes a ‘walker’ propagating at a constant velocity on the interface. This transition occurs just below the Faraday instability threshold, when the drop becomes a local emitter of a parametrically forced wave. A model of the particle–wave interaction accounts for this drift bifurcation. The self-organization of several identical bouncers is also investigated. At low forcing, bouncers form bound states or crystal-like aggregates. At larger forcing, the collisions between walkers reveal that their interaction can be either repulsive or attractive, depending on their distance apart. The attraction leads to the spontaneous formation of orbiting pairs, the possible orbit diameters forming a discrete set. A theoretical model of the non-local interaction resulting from the interference of the waves is given. The nature of the interaction is thus clarified and the various types of self-organization recovered.},

This article reviews experimental evidence indicating that the walking droplets exhibit certain features previously thought to be exclusive to the microscopic, quantum realm. It then reviews theoretical descriptions of this hydrodynamic pilot-wave system that yield insight into the origins of its quantumlike behavior. Quantization arises from the dynamic constraint imposed on the droplet by its pilot-wave ﬁeld, and multimodal statistics appear to be a feature of chaotic pilot-wave dynamics. I attempt to assess the potential and limitations of this hydrodynamic system as a quantum analog. This ﬂuid system is compared to quantum pilot-wave theories, shown to be markedly different from Bohmian mechanics and more closely related to de Broglie’s original conception of quantum dynamics, his double-solution theory, and its relatively recent extensions through researchers in stochastic electrodynamics.},

The droplet’s trajectory is described in terms of an integro-differential equation that incorporates the inﬂuence of its propulsive wave force. Predictions for the dependence of the orbital radius on the bath’s rotation rate compare favourably with experimental data and capture the progression from continuous to quantized orbits as the vibrational acceleration is increased. The orbital quantization is rationalized by assessing the stability of the orbital solutions, and may be understood as resulting directly from the dynamic constraint imposed on the drop by its monochromatic guiding wave. The stability analysis also predicts the existence of wobbling orbital states reported in recent experiments, and the absence of stable orbits in the limit of large vibrational forcing.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of droplets walking on a vertically vibrating ﬂuid bath. Several walking states are reported, including pure resonant walkers that bounce with precisely half the driving frequency, limping states, wherein a short contact occurs between two longer ones, and irregular chaotic walking. It is possible for several states to arise for the same parameter combination, including high- and low-energy resonant walking states. The extent of the walking regime is shown to be crucially dependent on the stability of the bouncing states. In order to estimate the resistive forces acting on the drop during impact, we measure the tangential coefﬁcient of restitution of drops impacting a quiescent bath. We then analyse the spatio-temporal evolution of the standing waves created by the drop impact and obtain approximations to their form in the small-drop and long-time limits. By combining theoretical descriptions of the horizontal and vertical drop dynamics and the associated wave ﬁeld, we develop a theoretical model for the walking drops that allows us to rationalize the limited extent of the walking regimes. The critical requirement for walking is that the drop achieves resonance with its guiding wave ﬁeld. We also rationalize the observed dependence of the walking speed on system parameters: while the walking speed is generally an increasing function of the driving acceleration, exceptions arise due to possible switching between different vertical bouncing modes. Special focus is given to elucidating the critical role of impact phase on the walking dynamics. The model predictions are shown to compare favourably with previous and new experimental data. Our results form the basis of the ﬁrst rational hydrodynamic pilot-wave theory.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of millimetric droplets bouncing on a vertically vibrating ﬂuid bath. We ﬁrst characterize the system experimentally, deducing the dependence of the droplet dynamics on the system parameters, speciﬁcally the drop size, driving acceleration and driving frequency. As the driving acceleration is increased, depending on drop size, we observe the transition from coalescing to vibrating or bouncing states, then perioddoubling events that may culminate in either walking drops or chaotic bouncing states. The drop’s vertical dynamics depends critically on the ratio of the forcing frequency to the drop’s natural oscillation frequency. For example, when the data describing the coalescence–bouncing threshold and period-doubling thresholds are described in terms of this ratio, they collapse onto a single curve. We observe and rationalize the coexistence of two non-coalescing states, bouncing and vibrating, for identical system parameters. In the former state, the contact time is prescribed by the drop dynamics; in the latter, by the driving frequency. The bouncing states are described by theoretical models of increasing complexity whose predictions are tested against experimental data. We ﬁrst model the drop–bath interaction in terms of a linear spring, then develop a logarithmic spring model that better captures the drop dynamics over a wider range of parameter space. While the linear spring model provides a faster, less accurate option, the logarithmic spring model is found to be more accurate and consistent with all existing data.},

We ﬁrst present a detailed characterization of the emergence of orbital quantization, and then examine the system behaviour at higher driving amplitudes. As the vibrational forcing is increased progressively, stable circular orbits are succeeded by wobbling orbits with, in turn, stationary and drifting orbital centres. Subsequently, there is a transition to wobble-and-leap dynamics, in which wobbling of increasing amplitude about a stationary centre is punctuated by the orbital centre leaping approximately half a Faraday wavelength. Finally, in the limit of high vibrational forcing, irregular trajectories emerge, characterized by a multimodal probability distribution that reﬂects the persistent dynamic inﬂuence of the unstable orbital states.},

An integro-differential equation describing the horizontal motion of the drop is developed by approximating the drop as a continuous moving source of standing waves. Our model indicates that, as the forcing acceleration is increased, the bouncing state destabilizes into steady horizontal motion along a straight line, a walking state, via a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation. Predictions for the dependence of the walking threshold and drop speed on the system parameters compare favourably with experimental data. By considering the stability of the walking state, we show that the drop is stable to perturbations in the direction of motion and neutrally stable to lateral perturbations. This result lends insight into the possibility of chaotic dynamics emerging when droplets walk in complex geometries.},

The walker, consisting of a droplet plus its guiding waveﬁeld, is a spatially extended object. We here examine the dependence of the walker mass and momentum on its velocity. Doing so indicates that, when the walker’s time scale of acceleration is long relative to the wave decay time, its dynamics may be described in terms of the mechanics of a particle with a speed-dependent mass and a nonlinear drag force that drives it towards a ﬁxed speed. Drawing an analogy with relativistic mechanics, we deﬁne a hydrodynamic boost factor for the walkers. This perspective provides a new rationale for the anomalous orbital radii reported in recent studies.},

We here present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical study of the interaction of walking droplets with a submerged planar barrier. Droplets exhibit non-specular reﬂection, with a small range of reﬂection angles that is only weakly dependent on the system parameters, including the angle of incidence. The observed behaviour is captured by simulations based on a theoretical model that treats the boundaries as regions of reduced wave speed, and rationalized in terms of momentum considerations.},

We present the details of an improved vibration system based on a concept developed by Goldman (2002) [1] which consists of a typical electrodynamic shaker with an external linear air bearing to more effectively constrain the vibration to a single axis. The principal components and design criteria for such a system are discussed. Measurements characterizing the performance of the system demonstrate considerable improvement over the unmodified test shaker. In particular, the maximum inhomogeneity of the vertical vibration amplitude is reduced from approximately 10 percent to 0.1 percent; moreover, transverse vibrations were effectively eliminated.},

One of the key effects, the quantum pump effect, is considered in detail. In addition, the theory for the recently implemented new dynamical source — injecting electrons with time delay much larger than an electron coherence time — is offered. This theory provides a simple description of quantum circuits with such a single-particle source and shows in an unambiguous way that the tunability inherent to the dynamical systems (in contrast to the stationary ones) leads to a number of unexpected but fundamental effects.},

The Pauli principle restricts the occupation of wave packets, spreading electrons more uniformly among the available packets, and thus reducing the noise below that of the classical shot-noise expression for totally uncorrelated electrons. After a brief review of the results for one-dimensional leads, we treat the case of the sample attached to two multichannel leads. A proper choice of basis for the wave packets permits this case to be reduced to that of a set of independent parallel one-channel samples. This picture is extended to the case of excess noise in multiterminal samples at zero temperature, leading to anticorrelated fluctuations between different leads. The anticorrelated fluctuations are analyzed, in particular detail for a Y-shaped three-lead sample. Our wave-packet approach is presented as a physically intuitive alternative to the existing approaches to mesoscopic noise, and leads to identical results.},
